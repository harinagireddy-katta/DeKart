# **Decentralized Marketplace with Smart Contract Escrow System**  

## **Overview**  
Traditional e-commerce platforms face issues such as:
- Lack of transparency in transactions.
- Centralized control over listings, payments, and fees.
- Fraudulent activities, including disputes over payments and product authenticity.  

Our project solves these problems by building a **decentralized e-commerce marketplace** that ensures **trustless and transparent transactions using blockchain and smart contracts**.

---

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Decentralized Trustless Transactions**: Removes intermediaries, enabling direct buyer-seller interaction.  
âœ… **Escrow Protection**: Payments are held securely until both parties confirm transaction completion.  
âœ… **Real-Time Bidding**: A fair auction system for competitive product pricing.  
âœ… **Blockchain Transparency**: Immutable records ensure fraud prevention.  
âœ… **Secure Smart Contracts**: Automates transactions and dispute resolution.

## **Project Architecture**  

### **1. User Flow**
1. **User Authentication & Wallet Connection**:  
   - Users sign in and connect their MetaMask wallet.  

2. **Product Listing**:  
   - Sellers add products via the smart contract.  
   - Products are listed on the blockchain with unique IDs.  

3. **Bidding & Purchase**:  
   - Buyers place bids or purchase directly using ETH and DeK tokens.  
   - Funds are locked in an **escrow smart contract** for security.  

4. **Transaction Completion**:  
   - Payment is **released** once the buyer confirms product receipt.  
   - In case of **dispute**, funds remain locked until resolved.  

---

## **Smart Contracts**
### **1. `DeKToken.sol`**  
- Implements an **ERC-20** token.  
- Used for transactions, cashback rewards, and premium access.  

### **2. `Marketplace.sol`**  
- **Manages product listings**, bidding, and purchases.  
- **Interacts with Escrow.sol** to secure payments.  

### **3. `Escrow.sol`**  
- Holds **ETH and DeK tokens** in escrow.  
- Prevents fraud by ensuring funds are only released upon buyer confirmation.
